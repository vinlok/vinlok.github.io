"Cyber is the rare kind of all-encompassing challenge for which the Congress's jurisdictional boundaries are an impediment to sufficient oversight and legislative action," McCain wrote to McConnell in a letter, cosigned by fellow GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
"Only a select committee that is time-limited, cross-jurisdictional, and purpose-driven can address the challenge of cyber," wrote the bipartisan quartet of senators. "We believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem."
