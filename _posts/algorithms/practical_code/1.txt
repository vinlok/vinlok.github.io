peter always saw the world in black and white there were two choices for every situation and you had to choose one of them it was therefore terribly uncomfortable for him to spend time with ashley she saw the world in shades of gray with hundreds of choices to choose from in every situation it was cloudy outside but not really raining there was a light sprinkle at most and there certainly wasn't a need for an umbrella this hadn't stopped sarah from pulling her umbrella out and opening it it had nothing to do with the weather or the potential rain later that day sarah used the umbrella to hide this is important to remember love isn't like pie you don't need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones no matter how much love you give you can always give more it doesn't run out so don't try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out give it freely and as much as you want do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens
