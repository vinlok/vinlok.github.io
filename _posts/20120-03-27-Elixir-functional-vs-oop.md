This post talk about key differences between OOP vs Functional languages.

** Objects vs Functions
- OOP works on the concepts of classes and object. Classes are collections of instances and methods. You have classes and methods associated with it. You instantiate a class with objects and then access the methods and variables local to the object.

- Functional programing works on modules. It is collections of methods or functions. There are no instance variables. There is no concept of instantiate a module. And example flow is something like this:

1. Module will have a function which will produce a result/data.
2. The result/data is fetched to other function which can perform come action on it.
