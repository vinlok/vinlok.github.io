### Terraform installation

Terraform is written in go lang. Each OS will have its executable named "terraform" which can be downloaded from https://www.terraform.io/. Just put the binary in $PATH variable and you are all set!


### HCL : HashiCorp Configuration Language
- Terraform is written in HCL which is a declarative languauge.
- HCL files are saved with .tf file extension.

### Providers:
- Terraform can provision instances/resources accross variety of cloud providers/platform such as google, AWS, VMWARE etc.
- These platforms are called as providers
- The most important platform of all is *aws*.

### Resource:
- Each provider has different resources it provides. Example, 'aws' provider has resources like security_group, instance.
- Resources creation has below syntax:
<pre>resource "PROVIDER_TYPE" "NAME" {
[VARIOUS CONFIGS]
 }

Example:
resource "aws_instance" "vinwebsrv001" {
	ami = "ami-1234566"
	instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
</pre> 

### Terraform plan:
- Plan command will show you the changes terraform is going to do.
- (+) shows resources which it is going to add
- (-) shows resources it is going to delete
- (~) shows resources it is going to change
